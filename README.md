# Forsaken Relics

Originally created as a card-dice game, Forsaken Relics has become an experiment in game design via web development technologies and AI tools.

The goal is to create a dungeon crawler experience similar to a cross between vintage DOS games like “Eye of the Beholder” and NES JRPG classics like “Dragon Warrior” and “Final Fantasy,” but with a modern twist using AI tools to enhance the gameplay experience and replayability.

All images were created using ChatGPT’s DALL-E model, often fine-tuned with Photoshop.

The game is not playable in its current state and contains files rolled forward from previous editions that are otherwise unused at this point. Otherwise, the code is available for those interested in learning from the project.
