# Forsaken Relics

Originally created as a card-dice game, Forsaken Relics has become an experiment in game design via web development technologies and AI tools.

The goal is to create a dungeon crawler experience similar to a cross between vintage DOS games like “Eye of the Beholder” and NES JRPG classics like “Dragon Warrior” and “Final Fantasy,” but with a modern twist using AI tools to enhance the gameplay experience and replayability.

All images were created using ChatGPT’s DALL-E model, often fine-tuned with Photoshop.

The game is not playable in its current state and contains files rolled forward from previous editions that are otherwise unused at this point. Otherwise, the code is available for those interested in learning from the project.

# Previous Versions

The digital version of this game has undergone several iterations as web technology trends have shifted and AI tools have improved.

1. PHP with Bootstrap (speed test the mechanics of the card-dice game)
2. Sveltekit with Tailwind CSS (prototype Svelte)
3. React Remix with Tailwind CSS (prototype Remix)
4. MUI with Vite

# Regions

Provide a short paragraph bio (2-3 sentences) for each creature that a game player would read. It should sound a unique blend between a wilderness survival guide, game lore, and local legend. It should be immersive and intriguing with a hint of mystery:

The game will randomly pick creatures that the player will fight, so avoid focusing the descriptions on pack/group dynamics, unless they gain a special synergy when there are more than one involved in a fight.

## Level 1: The Borderlands

### Short Description

A wild and untamed region where the safety of towns is threatened by marauding creatures and bandits. This area is on the fringes of a more developed kingdom or empire, but civilization has yet to fully claim it. The land is mostly rural, with patches of dense forest, rocky outcrops, and untended farmlands that are slowly being reclaimed by nature. Small villages dot the landscape, but the people here are used to fending for themselves against the threats that roam the wilderness.

The overall atmosphere of this area should feel dangerous but manageable, with the feeling that the wild is just starting to reclaim the land. It’s a place where people still live, but barely—villagers keep to themselves, and the road between outposts is dangerous due to roaming creatures and bandits. The deeper into the wilderness players go, the more ominous the atmosphere becomes, especially around ruins or caves, hinting at darker forces lurking in the shadows.

### Long Description

The Borderlands is a wild and untamed region on the fringes of a developed kingdom, where the thin grasp of civilization is constantly tested. It is a rugged expanse characterized by dense forests, rocky outcrops, and overgrown farmlands that have long been abandoned to nature’s relentless reclamation. Small villages and homesteads are scattered across the landscape, but they offer little sanctuary from the dangers that lurk in the wilderness. Here, the air is thick with the sense of abandonment, and every shadow seems to hide a lurking threat.

The people of The Borderlands are hardy and self-reliant, having adapted to a life of constant vigilance. With no formal protection from the distant authorities, they are accustomed to defending themselves against marauding creatures, ruthless bandits, and the occasional wandering beast. Survival in this harsh land depends on resourcefulness and courage, and the border folk take pride in their ability to carve out a living despite the chaos that surrounds them. Each day is a struggle, and alliances between villages are often forged out of necessity rather than trust.

Though it remains unclaimed by any formal power, The Borderlands holds a dangerous allure for adventurers, mercenaries, and those seeking fortune or escape. Ancient ruins and forgotten relics lie hidden among the trees and crags, whispering of past civilizations and untold secrets. It is a land where opportunity and peril walk hand in hand, promising both glory and ruin to those daring enough to venture beyond the safety of the village walls. In The Borderlands, every step is a gamble, and the price of failure is often paid in blood.

### Art Direction

**Overall Aesthetic:**
The Borderlands should evoke a sense of a dangerous, untamed frontier. The art style should balance realism and fantasy, with a gritty, worn-down look. The environment feels ancient and wild, as if civilization never fully tamed it, and now nature is reclaiming the land. Visuals should have a muted, earthy color palette with strong contrasts—dark shadows and moody lighting juxtaposed with occasional bursts of vibrant, natural colors like moss greens, autumnal reds, and sky blues.

**Environment Design:**
The landscapes of The Borderlands are varied and rugged, featuring dense forests, craggy hills, overgrown ruins, and decaying farmlands. Forests should be dense and foreboding, with towering trees, twisted roots, and thick underbrush that obscures visibility. Rocky areas should have jagged, uneven terrain with hidden paths and shadowy nooks. Villages are small, isolated, and look well-worn, with rustic wooden structures, patched roofs, and signs of makeshift defenses like wooden palisades and watchtowers. Each location should feel lived-in, with environmental storytelling elements like abandoned carts, overgrown gardens, and broken tools.

**Character and Creature Design:**
Characters in The Borderlands should appear rugged and practical, dressed in worn, utilitarian clothing suited for survival. Armor and weapons should look handcrafted and battle-worn, with visible signs of repair and age. Villagers have a weary but determined look, with strong, weathered features reflecting their hard lives. Creatures should be fearsome and varied, drawing inspiration from real-world wildlife with exaggerated, monstrous twists—sharp claws, glowing eyes, and menacing postures. Bandits and marauders should appear as dangerous and opportunistic, often clad in mismatched armor and rough, scavenged gear.

**Atmosphere and Lighting:**
The atmosphere should feel heavy and suspenseful, with a constant sense of impending danger. Lighting plays a key role in setting the mood—often dim, with long shadows cast by the dense forests and jagged rocks. Use fog, mist, and dappled sunlight filtering through trees to create a sense of mystery and hidden threats. Night scenes should be especially dramatic, with moonlit paths, flickering torches, and ominous silhouettes against the sky. Sound and particle effects like drifting leaves, distant howls, and fluttering crows add to the sense of an environment alive with unseen dangers.

### Enemies

- C: Giant Rat

  > Giant Rats thrive in places where decay has set in, growing fat on the spoils of neglect. Twice the size of any city vermin, their sharp teeth can gnaw through wood, bone, and flesh with ease. Wherever these creatures are found, disease is never far behind, and neither is the stench of death.

- C: Slime

  > Slimes are living hunger, an insatiable force of acidic ooze that consumes flesh with terrifying efficiency. Silent and slow, they cling to dark corners and damp places, waiting for the unwary. Many adventurers have found themselves paralyzed in horror as the Slime devours skin and muscle, leaving only bones behind while armor remains eerily untouched.

- C: Dusk Raven

  > Perched high in the branches, Dusk Ravens appear as the last light fades, watching with a cold, predatory gaze. Locals claim that its cry has long been linked to imminent death, as it refuses to wait for the land to claim its next victim.

- UC: Marauder (bandit)

  > Marauders are the scourge of the borderlands, lawless men and women who live by the blade and take what they can. Hardened by the brutality of life on the edge of civilization, these killers strike from ambush, leaving no survivors and no trace of their passing.

- UC: Burrowing Wasp

  > Travelers hear the faint, rhythmic hum before they feel the ground beneath them shift. The Burrowing Wasp is a master of patience, waiting just below the surface until its prey is close enough to strike. Its venom doesn’t kill outright, but the burning paralysis that follows is often enough to leave even the bravest adventurer helpless before it drags them underground.

- R: Wild Boar

  > Venture too close to the feeding grounds of a Wild Boar and they will attack in a blind fury. Territorial and aggressive, they will charge without hesitation, leaving shattered bones and gored bodies in their wake. If you’re nimble enough to dodge that, then their hide is thick enough to shrug off even the sharpest blade.

- R: Goblin Scout

  > Villagers often speak in hushed tones of Goblin Scouts—small, sharp-eyed creatures that slip through the borderlands like whispers in the wind. People have learned to avoid the roads at dusk, as far too many children and stragglers have disappeared without a sound, taken right from under their noses. If you see one, it’s not by chance—it’s been watching you for some time.

- VR: Dire Wolf

  > Massive and merciless, no howl is feared more than that of the Dire Wolf. Farmers say it’s not the size that kills, but the cold intelligence behind those eyes. These wolves stalk the edges of the forest, silent and patient, waiting for the moment when a lone traveler dares to stray too far from the safety of the village lights.

- VR: Bandit Leader

  > Some say the bandits that plague the borderlands are as brutal to their own as they are to outsiders. Their leader, however, is something else—whispers of his name travel faster than his blade. He doesn’t just take what he wants; he leaves a message, carved into the bodies of those foolish enough to cross him. The survivors, if any, are the warnings he leaves behind.

- NLE: Goblin Warrior

  > Stronger and more savage than its kin, the Goblin Warrior fights with brutal precision, showing no fear, no hesitation. Villagers whisper of those unfortunate enough to faced one, their bodies left as grim reminders of the strength hiding behind those cruel, yellow eyes.

## Level 2: The Darkwood

### Short Description

The Darkwood is an ancient, overgrown forest where the trees stretch high enough to blot out most sunlight, leaving the forest floor in perpetual twilight. Dense undergrowth, tangled roots, and misty paths make navigation difficult, and danger is always lurking just out of sight. The trees themselves seem hostile, casting long shadows, and the deeper you venture, the more unsettling the forest becomes.

The locals avoid the heart of the forest, leaving only the most daring or desperate to explore. This is a place where ancient beasts, primal humanoids, and the remnants of dark magic coexist, each waiting for a careless adventurer to wander too far from safety. Those who return from The Darkwood often bring back more than just cuts and bruises—they return changed, haunted by something they can't quite describe.

### Long Description

The Darkwood is an ancient, sprawling forest where towering trees stretch skyward, their gnarled branches intertwining to block out most sunlight. This creates a canopy so thick that the forest floor remains in a state of perpetual twilight, with only faint, dappled beams occasionally piercing through. Dense undergrowth, tangled roots, and winding, mist-shrouded paths make navigation treacherous, disorienting even the most seasoned travelers. Every step deeper into The Darkwood heightens a sense of unease; the air grows heavy and still, and a chill seems to hang just above the ground.

The trees themselves appear almost sentient, their twisted forms casting long, creeping shadows that shift and move as if alive. Their bark is rough and dark, often knotted with strange growths and covered in creeping moss and lichen, giving them a hostile, watchful appearance. The deeper one ventures, the more the forest seems to whisper in hushed tones, with the creaks of ancient wood and rustling leaves creating a symphony of unsettling noises. The undergrowth teems with unseen dangers, from hidden pits to venomous creatures and cunning predators that stalk the shadows.

Travelers who dare enter The Darkwood speak of an oppressive presence that seems to watch their every move. It is a place where the natural and unnatural blur, and where even the bravest feel the weight of countless eyes hidden in the dark. Legends say that once you lose your way, the forest itself conspires to keep you, twisting paths and shifting landmarks until escape feels impossible.

### Art Direction

**Overall Atmosphere:**
The Darkwood is a dense, ancient forest shrouded in near-constant twilight, where light struggles to penetrate the thick, tangled canopy. The environment should feel oppressive, claustrophobic, and unnaturally quiet, evoking a sense of unease and mystery.

**Trees:**
The trees are colossal, twisted, and gnarled, with dark, nearly black bark marked by deep grooves and knots. Branches are crooked and often intertwine overhead, creating a dense, interwoven canopy that blocks most sunlight. Many trees have thick, creeping moss, fungal growths, or strange luminescent lichen that faintly glow in the dark. The trees should appear ancient and almost hostile, with claw-like branches and ominous, looming silhouettes.

**Undergrowth:**
The forest floor is cluttered with tangled roots, thorny bushes, and thick patches of undergrowth that hinder movement. Plants are dark green, muted, or tinged with grays and purples, emphasizing an otherworldly, unnatural appearance. Mushrooms and other fungi are common, often appearing in clusters near tree roots, with some glowing faintly in the shadows.

**Lighting:**
Lighting is minimal, with dappled, weak sunlight occasionally breaking through the canopy, casting soft, diffuse beams and long, exaggerated shadows. The overall palette is muted, with a focus on dark, earthy tones—deep greens, browns, and blacks, accented by faint blues or purples in the shadows. The few light sources might include faint bioluminescence from certain plants or distant, eerie glows from unknown origins.

**Paths and Terrain:**
Paths are narrow, winding, and often obscured by fog or low-hanging mist. They should feel precarious, with uneven terrain, hidden pitfalls, and the constant suggestion of movement just beyond the player's vision. Stones, roots, and decaying logs are frequent obstacles, with the occasional hint of long-forgotten ruins or ancient, weathered statues half-swallowed by nature.

**Creatures and Flora:**
The Darkwood's wildlife is elusive and often unseen, but hints of predatory eyes or shadows flitting between trees should be felt. Plants are often thorny, spiked, or otherwise intimidating, with some appearing to have a sentient quality. The forest should feel alive, not just with creatures, but as if the flora itself is watching, waiting, and ready to react.

### Enemies

- C: Kobold

  > Well-known as a cowardly scoundrel, the Kobold insists on using any advantage it can to turn the fight in its favor. Skulking through the shadows of the forest, they are quick and resourceful, always looking for a way to strike from behind. Underestimate it, and you'll quickly find yourself on the wrong end of its blade!

- C: Barkhound

  > Unique to The Darkwood, locals claim that the Barkhound was born from the twisted magic of the Goblin Shaman. Its bark-like hide is nearly impenetrable, and its eyes burn with an unnatural hunger. Moving silently between the trees, the Barkhound is a predator that seems to breathe with the forest itself—patient, relentless, and stronger than anything natural that stalks the woods.

- C: Gibberling

  > Few creatures are as unsettling as the Gibberling, a twisted mockery of humanity with wild eyes and a constant, incoherent muttering that never ceases. It stalks the dark paths of the forest, its frenzied mind driving it into unpredictable, violent outbursts. Though small, its erratic nature makes it a dangerous foe—one moment it’s cringing, the next it’s clawing at your throat with primal rage.

- UC: Giant Spider

  > The forest's darker corners are home to creatures that thrive in the silence, none more feared than the Giant Spider. Its webs stretch unseen between trees, a near-invisible trap for anything wandering too far from safety. Its hairy legs move silently across the forest floor, while venomous fangs drip with a toxin that paralyzes its prey within moments.

- UC: Minotaur Lizard

  > With its thick, scaly hide and horns that curve like a bull’s, the Minotaur Lizard is both a terrifying sight and a relentless predator. While its head is built for intimidation rather than goring, its true danger lies in its claws—sharp enough to tear flesh with every strike. Aggressive by nature, this foul-tempered beast will unleash its ferocity at any hint of threat.

- R: Orc Grunt

  > Orc Grunts are the embodiment of unbridled savagery. Armed with crude weapons and a thirst for violence, these hulking brutes care little for strategy or finesse, relying instead on raw strength and bloodlust to overwhelm their enemies. Their presence is marked by guttural roars, a grim prelude to the carnage that follows.

- R: Hobgoblin Soldier

  > Hobgoblins are nothing like their Goblin kin. Disciplined and relentless, the Hobgoblin Soldier fights with a precision born from years of harsh training. Clad in rusted but well-kept armor, they move through the forest with a cold, militaristic focus, cutting down their enemies with efficient, practiced strikes. Every blow is calculated, every movement purposeful, leaving no room for escape.

- VR: Goblin Shaman

  > Goblin Shamans are feared not for their size, but for the ancient, twisted magic they command. Deep in the heart of the forest, they weave dark spells that warp the mind and curse the land. The air around them grows thick and heavy, and the shadows seem to move with a will of their own—marks of the primal forces these sinister creatures have bound to their will.

- VR: Timberback Bear

  > The Timberback Bear roams the deepest parts of the forest, its fur thick with moss and bark, blending seamlessly into the surroundings. It is a force of nature—silent, deliberate, and impossibly strong. Locals say the earth trembles beneath its massive paws, and that it has lived for centuries, a guardian of the darkest groves.

- NLE: Hobgoblin Chieftain

  > The Hobgoblin Chieftain rules with a cold, unyielding authority. Battle-hardened and ruthless, he is as skilled in warfare as he is in breaking the spirits of those under his control. Clad in battle-worn armor, his every command is carried out with military precision, and his presence on the battlefield signals the kind of calculated brutality that leaves no survivors.

## Level 3: The Keep

Once a proud stronghold of stone and steel, The Keep now stands as a crumbling relic of a long-dead kingdom, overtaken by decay and haunted by the dead. Its once-imposing towers have fallen into moss-covered rubble, and the great halls now serve as a tomb for those who died defending it—or those unlucky enough to stumble across its cursed grounds. The stones themselves seem to groan under the weight of the past, as if remembering the battles and betrayals that sealed its fate.

The Keep is a place of quiet dread, where every gust of wind feels like the last whisper of those who once lived here. Time has worn away its grandeur, but the echo of power remains, haunting the grounds like a shadow that never quite leaves. Strange creatures, both living and dead, have made their homes here, and the very air feels thick with lingering sorrow and ancient malice. Venturing into The Keep feels like trespassing in a graveyard, with each step bringing adventurers closer to the unquiet dead that still call it home.

- C: Zombie

  > Dragged back from death by the lingering curses of the Keep, the Zombie is a shambling mockery of life. Its decayed flesh clings to bones long past their prime, and though it moves slowly, there’s no hesitation in its relentless pursuit. Unburdened by pain or fear, it fights with the mindless determination of something that has nothing left to lose.

- C: Skelelizard

  > Once the swift predators of the Keep’s forgotten dungeons, these skeletal remains now scuttle across the ruins. The bones of the Skelelizard grind and rattle with every movement, and its hollow eyes burn with an eerie, unnatural light. Don’t be fooled by its size—its speed and sharp, bony claws are far more dangerous than its frail appearance suggests.

- C: Crypt Bat

  > Flitting through the darkened halls of the Keep, the Crypt Bat moves in near silence, its leathery wings blending into the shadows. Roosting in ancient tombs and forgotten crypts, it strikes swiftly at anything disturbing the still air. The corpses scattered throughout the Keep bear telltale signs of their savage bites, a grim reminder that not all deaths here are caused by the undead.

- UC: Skeleton Soldier

  > Once proud defenders of the Keep, these soldiers now wander the ruins, their souls trapped by the tragedy of their abrupt demise. Bound to the place where they fell, they continue their eternal patrol, armor clattering with every step. There is no thought behind their hollow eyes—only the faint echo of duty, long lost to time and sorrow.

- UC: Ghoul

  > Twisted by their insatiable hunger, Ghouls prowl the ruins of the Keep, drawn to the scent of decaying flesh. Their eyes burn with an unnatural thirst, and their claws can tear through flesh and bone with terrifying ease. Once human, their desire to feed on the dead has cursed them to a life of endless hunger, forever bound to the corpses they feast upon.

- R: Lamenting Spirit

  > Its mind shattered by sorrow, the Lamenting Spirit roams the Keep in a state of tortured confusion. One moment, its mournful wails echo through the crumbling corridors as it searches endlessly for loved ones lost to the tragedy. The next, it lashes out at any stranger it perceives as an intruder. Those who encounter the spirit are often drawn into its grief, seeing twisted visions of its final moments, before it ferociously unleashes its blind rage.

- R: Wight

  > Once a proud figure in life, the Wight is now a cruel, corrupted soul, cursed to walk the Keep as a reflection of its former glory. Its cold, piercing gaze strips the warmth from the air, and its touch drains the strength of the living. Not entirely mindless, the Wight retains the bitter memories of its life, and its hatred for the living festers, lashing out at any who dare to step into its forsaken domain.

- VR: Gargoyle

  > Perched upon the crumbling walls of the Keep, the Gargoyle waits, motionless and silent, blending into the ancient stone. Once a guardian, now twisted by the centuries, it has become something far darker. Its eyes gleam with malice, and when it awakens, its stone wings spread with a grinding roar, ready to hunt those who disturb its resting place. More than just stone, the Gargoyle is relentless, and its jagged claws can rend flesh as easily as they once protected it.

- VR: Skeleton Knight

  > The Skeleton Knight strides through the ruins as if unaware of its own death, driven by a duty it can never fulfill. Clad in battle-worn armor and wielding a blade sharpened through centuries of ceaseless training, it fights with precision honed beyond the limits of life. Its eyes are black voids, and to meet its gaze is to feel the very essence of life slipping away. Relentless and unyielding, the Skeleton Knight continues its eternal vigil, refusing to fail again, even in death.

- NLE: Revenant

  > Driven by an insatiable hunger for vengeance, the Revenant is bound to its decaying body by sheer hatred. Wronged in life and denied peace in death, it stalks the ruins of the Keep, hunting down those it deems responsible—or anyone unfortunate enough to cross its path. Its strength is terrifying, and its resilience defies the decay of time. Once it sets its sights on a target, it pursues with relentless focus, cutting through any obstacle until it exacts its final, brutal justice.
